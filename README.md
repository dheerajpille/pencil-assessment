# Pencil Learning Technologies: Fall 2020 SWE Intern Assessment

This project is an assessment for the Fall 2020 SWE Intern role at Pencil Learning Technologies. It is an Angular application with the following components:

1. User authentication: Use Firebase to support authentication in your application, so that
the first screen a user sees, asks them to login via their google account. If the user is
detected to have been already authenticated, then directly take them to the 2nd page.
2. Text editor: Once logged in, show a large textbox on the page integrated with the
Medium editor (https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) and allow the user to write
content in this editor area.
3. Everything the user writes here, should be synced into the Firebase database in
real-time for that userâ€™s account, automatically, without hitting a submit button.
4. When the user logs back in, retrieve their last written and auto-saved document and
show it in the editor ready for editing.
5. Host your project using Firebase hosting and send us a link, along with your code on
GitHub.
